## Design Philosophy & Aesthetics

* **Overall Theme:** A sophisticated and modern design featuring a primary red color palette (ranging from deep crimson to brighter, energetic reds for accents).
* **Translucency:** Incorporates translucent elements (like frosted glass effects or semi-transparent overlays) for content backgrounds, cards, and the navigation bar to create depth and layering.
* **Typography:**
    * **Headings:** Utilizes a clear and elegant serif font (e.g., Merriweather, Playfair Display) for strong visual hierarchy.
    * **Body Text:** Employs a highly readable sans-serif font (e.g., Open Sans, Roboto) for paragraphs, lists, and captions, ensuring excellent readability.
* **Layout:** Clean, well-organized, and intuitive, utilizing a responsive grid system with ample whitespace for a polished look across all device sizes.
* **Imagery:** Designed to integrate impactful, high-quality images related to environmental themes, sustainability, and technology, with consistent styling and subtle load animations.

## Interactive & Dynamic Elements

* **Parallax Scrolling:** Subtle parallax scrolling effects are implemented on background images or within specific sections to add depth and visual interest as the user scrolls.
* **Hover Animation (Rectangle to Squircle):** Content boxes, cards, and distinct informational sections feature a smooth hover animation where the element transitions from a standard rectangle to a squircle shape. This transition is fluid and may include a slight shadow lift or subtle change in translucent background opacity.
* **General Hover Effects:** Links, buttons, and navigation items have clear and subtle hover effects (e.g., color change, underline, slight scale) for enhanced user feedback.
* **Micro-interactions:** Small, subtle feedback mechanisms such as form field focus changes and button click effects enhance the overall user experience.

## Responsiveness & Accessibility

The website is built with a mobile-first approach, ensuring full responsiveness and optimal performance on all devices and screen sizes. Adherence to basic web accessibility standards (WCAG AA) is a priority, including:

* Sufficient color contrast ratios.
* Keyboard navigation for all interactive elements.
* Descriptive `alt` text for images.
* Use of semantic HTML for improved structure and screen reader compatibility.
